# App Description

This Lightning app allows to create "Journeys" for trainees, which are tasks that need to be completed when joining a team. The Template object provides those tasks. Each Template record has a list of tasks relevant to the specific team fucntion. From inside a template record we can create a new Journey which will automatically insert those tasks into the Journey. 


- Tasks Progress: Green -> Completed/Yellow -> In Progress/Red - Overdue / Bar to show the completion percentage
